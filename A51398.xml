         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nay let us aſſure our ſelves our Life is of no long continuance. What ſpeak we of to morrow, or this day, when we are not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35241:14"/> ſure of the leaſt part of times diviſion, a very hour; nay leſs. <hi>Watch therefore,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>for ye neither know the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come.</hi> What is our Life but a Few hours! and in one of them death muſt on neceſſity come; For <hi>'tis appointed for all men once to die, and after that the Judgment.</hi> O let us watch then, for the hour is at hand, and we do not know how ſoon it will ſeize upon us; this very hour the breath we draw may be our infection, this very hour the bread we eat may be our poyſon, this very hour the cup we drink of may be that bitter cup that may never paſs from us; this very night may our ſouls be required of us.

He that once thought to begin to take his eaſe, was fain that very night, whether he would or no, to make his end: would you have thought this? He but now flouriſhed like a green bay tree, his thoughts full of mirth, his ſoul of eaſe; but I paſſed by, and lo he was goue. Gone! whither? his body to the grave, his ſoul to hell; whoſe turn may be next, God only knows, who knoweth all. But whoſoever we be that go on in a courſe of ſin, in the name of God let us ſeriouſly bethink our ſelves of Mortality; how many have we heard of that went well to bed over night, for ought any man could tell, and yet have been found dead the next mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

O help us to repent of all our ſins by crying, and ſighing, and ſorrowing for ſin; It may be this night, and that is not long to come, but we may ſleep our laſt in this world. O keep us that we go not to bed with a conſcience laden with ſin. O how ſhould we take any reſt or ſleep with the brother of death, when we lie down in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35241:16"/> danger of eternal death. O there is no more but a breath, one breath and no more; no more but a ſtep, one ſtep and no more. Oh were not this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, that ſome One of us, who are ſtanding or ſitting here, ſhould this night ſleep his laſt, and to morrow have his body carried to his Grave; yea, and before to morrow morning, which the good Lord in mercy forbid, have his ſoul caſt from a bed of Feathers into a bed of Fire. And yet alas! alas? if any of us ſhould die this night in our ſins, or in an unregenerated ſtate, thus will it be with whomſoever we be. To morrow may our bodies be cold under earth, and our ſouls frying in the flames of hell. 'Tis good for us all to expect death every day; and by this means death foreſeen cannot poſſibly be ſudden; No, 'tis he dies ſuddenly that dies unpreparedly: Watch therefore, ſaith our Saviour; be ever in a readineſs, and as we tender the everlaſting wellfare of our poor ſouls, let us learn that Leſſon of our bleſſed Saviour, not to lay up for our ſelves treaſures on earth, where Moth and Ruſt doth corrupt, and where Thieves break through and ſteal; but lay up for our ſelves treaſure in heaven, where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where Thieves do not break thro' and ſteal; it is thoſe treaſures, thoſe ſtocks of grace that will laſt us for ever, which is a circumſpect walking, that Fervency of ſpirit, that Zeal of good works, that purity of conſcience St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of, which is the property of every true hearted profe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35241:17"/> if while it is called to day we could make our peace with our peace with our heavenly Father, by an humble exerciſe of repentance. If in this time of grace we could purchaſe Gods Favour, and thoſe rareſt Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Faith and a good conſcience; if now before we come to appear at that dreadful Tribunal, that we could be ſo happy as to make God and Chriſt our Friends in the Court of Heaven, O how wellcom and how bleſſed then would our death be unto us, come it never ſo ſuddenly, ſtill ſhould death find us ready, and if ready, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how ſuddenly, yea tho it were this night. Oh help us ſeriouſly to conſider what Jeſus Chriſt did and ſuffered for us and for our ſins: O how was he ſorrowful even unto death, with exceeding ſorrow, which made him pray, that the cup might paſs from him; yet with ſubmiſſion to his Fathers will; and all to ſave our poor loſt and undone ſouls: O the riches and love, and the free grace of Jeſus Chriſt to us: Oh the earneſtneſs of his prayers, and the agony he was in; not drops of water only, but his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. O how was he buffeted, ſpit on, reviled, mocked and ſcourged ſor our ſins: Oh how was the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins laid upon him, and by his ſtripes are we healed. And dear Father, do thou be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to keep up in us an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this abundant love wherewith the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath bound us: he was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Thorns for our ſins, that we through his merits might be crown'd with glory in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. O unſpeakable love! how were his tender hands and feet nailed to the Croſs! his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35241:17"/> holy unſpotted breaſt peirced with a ſpear, and his deareſt hearts blood let forth, and all to ſave our poor ſouls from the pit of eternal deſtruction. O let us conſider the great neceſſity we are in, in not looking unto this Jeſus: we have need of Chriſt; we have need that he pray in us, and need that he pray for us unto our heavenly Father: we have need that he work in us, and need that he work for us of his pleſſed will and pleaſure. We have need that he preſent us and ours blameleſs before his Fathers preſence in life and death, and at the Judgment day. O Lord, there is not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our lives wherein we ſtand not in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual need of Jeſus Chriſt. O then let our neceſſities drive us to Chriſt, and mind us of Chriſt. And as it hath been our great miſery in departing from God, dear Father, we beſeech thee to cauſe us now to lay out all our ſtrength by the bleſſed aſſiſtance of thy holy ſpirit of grace to the uttermoſt of our power, to gain a reconciliation with God, &amp; to cloſe with him on his own terms propounded to us in the Goſpel.
